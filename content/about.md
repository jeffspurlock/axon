# Axon Development Studio

### A Decentralized Digital Agency

After years of developing for both small businesses and corporations, Axon Studios has become my creative outlet and passion project. My vision is a one-stop shop for marketing on the internet, starting first with building amazing websites, and building a full stack of marketing platform integrations, business automation, and on going technical support. 

With my past history in various spaces in the digital marketing realm, and a long history of professional contacts in the industry, I can assemble a team of contractors unique to your needs, with fast turn around times, to get your web project off the ground in weeks.

### Non-Profit Organizations
If you are a 501(c)(3) non-profit, I have experience navigating Google's non-profit benefits, including $10,000 per month in free advertising with Google Ad Grants, free Google Workspace licensing. I've also been known to have a soft spot when it comes to pricing out packages for non-profits if your cause is something I believe is important. 

### About me
When hiring contractors, its a little like hiring an employee. We'll be working together a lot. With that in mind, here's a little about myself on a personal level. 

I was born and raised just outside Los Angeles before moving to Omaha during the COVID lockdowns. My wife and I have two amazing daughters, and I'm lucky enough to learn more about patience and empathy every single day.

- When you get a song stuck in your head that you haven't heard for years, and never really liked in the first place, but for some reason it just keeps playing on repeat in your brain over and over and over for days on end
