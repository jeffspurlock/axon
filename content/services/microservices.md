# Microservices
Sometimes you don't need a whole website, sometimes you don't even need a server. Extending website functionality can sometimes cause headaches due to technical debt. Maybe your server runs on apache, but the tools you need run on node. Maybe your WordPress site is buttoned up exactly how you want it, you just need one custom feature. This is where microservices can make a huge impact. Running tasks asyncronously in either a cloud instance or a serverless function allows us to create robust custom functionality and business logic without touching your website's back end or styling.

Installation is as simple as pasting a `<div id="my-microservice-container"></div>` into your site code, and we do the rest. What do you wish your site could do? Lets make it happen.
