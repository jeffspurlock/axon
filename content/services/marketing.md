# Digital Marketing
Just like my background in web development can be tied back to things my Father taught me, my experience in Digital Marketing does as well. In the early aughts, he began managing Google AdWords campaigns and tuning sites for better SEO performance. When I was in college, as a side job I took over many of his clients accounts and managed a few million dollars in annual marketing spend.

While AdWords is great, it cannot be your only channel anymore. A successful marketing plan will cater to every step of the sales funnel, and capture users at every point in the customer journey. Every business has different needs, but a fairly standard approach includes: 
- Targeted display network ads for high funnel prospecting
- SEO and search campaigns for users trying to find you or the services you provide
- Retargeting ads to engage prospective buyers
- Automated email and SMS tools for follow ups and abandoned carts
- eMail marketing campaigns for reengagement and increasing LTV
- And crucially, reporting all of this data into an analytics tool.

If your website is struggling for sales or traffic, lets chat about what channels you are and are not targeting, and see what kind of an advertising investment can bring the sales lift you're looking for.
