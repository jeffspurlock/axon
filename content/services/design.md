# UI/UX Design
Thanks to frameworks like React, Angular, and my personal favorite, Vue, Component Based Design has taken over the UI/UX world. In this site, I wanted to avoid the use of component libraries and focus on developing my own custom components, but for fast protoyping and feature rich components, the modern marketplace for Component Libraries has made building an easy to navigate and functional UI easier than ever before. Coming from the Vue school, I've build sites using popular component libraries suchs a Vuetify, PrimeVue and Quasar.  

But the latest and greatest tools aren't always an option when working on legacy sites and platforms. I began my career doing most of my UI work with jquery and vanilla JavaScript; indispensible tools when dealing with things like XSS Components or legacy projects.
