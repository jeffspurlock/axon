# Node.js
Apache and Nginx were great, but their time has passed. Some might evn argue Node is as well with the popularity of new backend languages like Rust and Go, but I find the flexibility of writing backend and frontend logic with the same language to be a superior developer experience. The convenience of npm packages for both server modules and front end libraries can't be beat.

Node is a mature software as well, building on 14 years of history since it initial release. With tools like Express.js, Sails.js, Nuxt.js, and more, there are more than enough backend server architectures to suit any project you have in mind.
