# Web Development
My web development journey is mostly rooted in my childhood. Before I turned 10, my Father began teaching me how to build web site using Microsoft FrontPage. For those unfamiliar, this was a desktop application with a WYSIWYG editor, allowing you to build web pages the same way you might assemble a word document. It helped a lot for understanding some of the basic around page structure and HTML, but had lots of short comings; specifically when it came to CSS.

I got frustrated, so I decided to learn CSS. When I was in Middle School and High School, I charged $5 to do custom styling for other students MySpace pages. Then I started building in WordPress. Didn't really know how to program much yet, but it was great introduction to the art form.

During College I took a few programming classes and was mentored by a friend of mine who is a Ruby on Rails developer. I began learning Rails, and realized I hated the Ruby language; so I switched to developing in JavaScript, and never looked back. My typical stack is a node.js backend, running Nuxt for middleware, and Vue for front end. That being said, I've also developed and maintained custom applications in:
- Drupal 
- Wordpress
- Sails.js
- Shopify
- ASP.NET
