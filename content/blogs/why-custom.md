# The Superior Edge of Custom-Developed Websites Over Website Builders

### Introduction to Website Development Options
Wix and Squarespace (henceforth referred to as 'Out Of The Box (OOTB) Site Platforms') have created incredible tools for building good looking, performant websites, with the ease of managed DNS, managed hosting, managed SSL, managed everything... It's truly simple, no web experience required. 

This is great for many small businesses, and the last thing I would want is to sell you on a web application that you didn't really need. Lets dive into some of the limitations of the OOTB Site platforms and see if a custom application is right for your business. 

### Customization and Unique Branding
Your users will interact with your websites frontend, or UI. Traditionally, your front end exists of a lot of HTML, some CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactive page elements. This is still the basis for all websites, but when you move beyond a site generator like the OOTB Site Platforms, you can leverage modern JavaScript tools to create beautiful UIs, with user interaction, animation, transitions, and something called attribute binding. Content and Components become completely dynamic. The left hand menu bar next this blog post is a great example; my page layout takes a navigation component that is dynamically selected based on the page you're viewing. Swapping these components when visiting a new page creates the feeling of a native application, rather than just a traditional website. These modern tools aren't really possible on an OOTB Site Platform. There are ways to incorporate reactive elements, but its not clean, and slows down your site performance.

In addition to a reactive front end, we have to talk about page layout. The OOTB Site Platforms have tons of themes to pick from, and you can edit your colors, and logos, and even rearrange blocks or add new ones, but the more you modify a site on an OOTB platform, the more complicated maintaining your custom implementation becomes. Trying to reinvent a theme to your exact design idea isn't a fun experience and you're much better off just using their theme components and design and leaving it at that. If you need a custom layout with no limitations, there is no substitute for a custom web application to handle it. 

There are obvious negatives; budget being the elephant in the room. Custom development costs significantly more to build, however, ongoing license fees with the OOTB Site Platforms will rack up over time, and using a third party hosting solution can be cheaper. The other budget related item is maintenance and updates. With an OOTB Site Platform, you could likely tell the youngest employee at your company "Hey, make these changes, here's the log in" and they would be able to figure it out. With a custom web application, you'll likely need someone with a more technical background to make changes. Whoever you choose to build your custom application, will likely have services plans for ongoing support and maintenance.

### Scalability and Integration
What happens when your site goes viral? What if your product becomes the next hit item on TikTok or some celebrity talks about it in a podcast? OOTB Site Platforms do a fairly decent job scaling for traffic, but you will be at the mercy of their servers. With a custom application deployed to a server you have control over, scalability is baked in from the beginning. Leveraging CloudFlare's CDN will allow for distributed caching at edge servers, meaning your website is geographically close to your users, cutting down on latency, and replicated across several markets, removing bandwidth concerns from your host. 

Another key advantage to running your own server is writing middleware APIs to handle backend integrations. If someone fills out a Contact form, we can integrate it directly with your CRM<sup>1</sup>. If someone makes a purchase, we can integrate it directly with your ERP or warehouse management solution<sup>1</sup>. If you want to display information from an internal database or a third party SaaS provider, we can query that and display it on the site<sup>1</sup>. The possibilities for integration are endless, but with an OOTB Site Platform you'll have a hard time integrating with any platform that doesn't offer a one-click integration installation.

### SEO and Performance Optimization
OOTB Site Platforms have come a long way in terms of SEO performance, mostly because of internal changes Google has made around their algorithms. Custom web applications have the ability to cater your content for the algorithm though using page schema that can be read by Google's crawlers. Other key aspects for SEO performance include site speed, semantic HTML, and implementation of ARIA for accessibility. The rest comes down to content; quality content, rich with keywords you're trying to be recognized for by the crawler. My team of content writers think SEO first, and can get you quality content, designed to reach your audience. 

### eCommerce
As with every rule, there are exceptions. Shopify qualifies as an OOTB Site Provider, but they've gone to extreme lengths to make your site pages and templates customizable. So much so, that it loses the "easy to use" nature of most OOTB providers when you need to make these kind of custom changes. Some of the premium themes come with a lot of support for page design and layout, and some of the shopify apps, like Shogun, will give you a WYSIWYG editor, but sooner or later the limitations of these will cause road blocks. Custom Shopify implementation takes several forms; from page design and layout, all the way to running a headless store with Shopify Hydrogen and a React UI to use it. The right solution is highly dependent on your use case. 

## To sum it up
I don't want you to pay for something you don't need, but I can absolutely help you determine those needs and make recommendations. Your solution needs to be catered to your use case, and sometimes the easiest solution is the right solution; but when its not, you need pro to help navigate you system requirements and custom solutions.
